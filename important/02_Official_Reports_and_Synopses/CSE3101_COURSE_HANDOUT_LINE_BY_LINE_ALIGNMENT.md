Page 7 of the course handout establishes three non-negotiable governance policies:

### 4.1 Mandatory Role Rotation Across Phases
> *"All students are expected to contribute across core components (Agents, Tools, Orchestrator, etc. and integrations). While tasks may be divided within teams, roles must rotate across phases. No student may limit their contribution to a single area (e.g., only tool design, only UI or documentation)."*

**Kavach Role Rotation Execution:**
```
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                    PHASE-WISE ROLE ROTATION                                        |
+-------------------+------------------------------+------------------------+------------------------+
| Evaluation Phase  | Member 1 (Dhruv Jain)        | Member 2               | Member 3               |
+-------------------+------------------------------+------------------------+------------------------+
| **PHASE 1**       | Architecture Lead            | Security Guard Lead    | RAG & Vector Store Lead|
| (Foundations)     | (State Machine & PEAS)       | (PII & Secret Engine)  | (Qdrant & Chunking)    |
+-------------------+------------------------------+------------------------+------------------------+
| **PHASE 2**       | Self-Healing & Sandbox Lead  | AST Blast Radius Lead  | Frontend & Voice Lead  |
| (Prototype)       | (ReAct Reflection Loop)      | (Static Code Graph)    | (Dashboard & Whisper)  |
+-------------------+------------------------------+------------------------+------------------------+
| **PHASE 3**       | MCP & Interoperability Lead  | Empirical Benchmark    | CI/CD Webhook & SBOM   |
| (Final Capstone)  | (Cursor/Claude Integration)  | (42 Runs & IEEE Tests) | (GitHub Actions Gate)  |
+-------------------+------------------------------+------------------------+------------------------+
```

### 4.2 Viva Defense & Code Modification Readiness
> *"During evaluation (demo/viva), each student should be able to explain and modify any part of the project. Individual performance will be assessed based on demonstrated understanding of all components."*
- Full defense cheatsheet available in [`VIVA_DEFENSE_CHEATSHEET.md`](file:///important/04_Viva_Defense_and_Evaluation/VIVA_DEFENSE_CHEATSHEET.md).
- Interactive examiner trap questions and live code modification exercises documented in [`VIVA_DEFENSE_AND_EVALUATION_GUIDE.md`](file:///important/04_Viva_Defense_and_Evaluation/VIVA_DEFENSE_AND_EVALUATION_GUIDE.md).

### 4.3 Mandatory Public GitHub Repository
> *"There is a mandatory requirement to upload the project to a public repository on GitHub."*
- Repository URL: **`https://github.com/jaindhruv1923/KAVACH`**

## 🚀 SECTION 6: HOW TO DEMONSTRATE TO EXAMINERS (100% VIVA READY)

When presenting to **Dr. Soharab Hossain Shaikh** and **Mr. Pranshu Tiwari**, execute these demonstration sequences:

### Step 1: Prove System Health & Full Test Suite (10 Seconds)
```bash
python verify_project.py
```
*Expected Output:*
- `Pytest Exit Code: 0 (PASS)` across all 302+ unit, integration, and security tests.
- `CI Security Gate Exit Code: 0 (PASS)`.
- 10/10 E2E Cyber Defense Verifications passed.

### Step 2: Demonstrate Google ADK & Multi-Agent Workflows
1. Send a POST request to `/adk/run` with task: *"Audit repository and synthesize patch"*.
2. Show the `CoordinatorAgent` delegating sub-tasks across `SentinelADK` and `CoderADK`.
3. Open `/adk/workflow/graph` to show DAG topological execution.

### Step 3: Demonstrate Emerging Protocols (MCP & A2A)
1. Show the MCP manifest at `/mcp/manifest` proving JSON-RPC 2.0 readiness for Cursor IDE.
2. Show the A2A peer discovery at `/a2a/peers` and multi-agent consensus vote at `/a2a/consensus`.

### Step 4: Demonstrate All 4 Reasoning Strategies (ReAct, CoT, ToT, Self-Consistency)
1. Post a complex architectural question to `/reasoning/strategies`.
2. Walk through the comparative performance table contrasting:
   - **ReAct:** Tool observation grounding.
   - **CoT:** Deductive transparency.
   - **ToT:** Multi-branch heuristic pruning.
   - **Self-Consistency:** Stochastic variance elimination.

### Step 5: Demonstrate Air-Gapped Local LLM & Data Privacy (CO2)
1. Toggle Air-Gapped mode via `/config/privacy-routing` (`air_gapped: true`).
2. Show that external network egress is terminated, and inference routes to local **Ollama** (`qwen2.5-coder`).
3. Show the Zero-Knowledge Token Vault replacing Aadhaar and PAN numbers with synthetic differential tokens.

### Step 6: Demonstrate Multimodal Vision Reasoning
1. Post an architecture diagram description to `/security/multimodal/vision-audit`.
2. Show the auditor flagging unencrypted plaintext links, public database exposure, and credential leaks.

## 🎯 Final Examiner Summary & Conclusion

Kavach is **not an abstract conceptual proposal** or a superficial prompt wrapper. It is a **fully implemented, empirically evaluated, and rigorously verified Agentic AI platform** that:
1. Directly addresses **every session, module, and learning outcome** of the **CSE3101 Agentic AI Course Handout**.
2. Conforms strictly to university team responsibility guidelines with **documented role rotation**.
3. Combines state-of-the-art frameworks (**CrewAI, Google ADK**) with open protocols (**MCP, A2A**) and cybersecurity rigor (**Zero-Knowledge Vault, Merkle Tree DPDP Ledger, AST Slopsquatting Firewall**).
4. Provides full academic submission artifacts: IEEE publication draft, 24-slide Master presentation deck, 42-run benchmark dataset, and 302+ passing automated tests.
